The problem is as follows:

We don't have good temperature records before about 1850, and even then only in the major industrialized countries. (Thomas Jefferson kept a weather diary with temperature readings for over 50 years.  Here's a site to compare his readings with what the weather is now. https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/weather-observations/Links to an external site.).

So people look for substitutes. The famous French historian (and national librarian) Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie worked with the dates of the wine harvest.

Here's some collected wine grape dates.

Please pick a place and plot the harvest date over the centuries, smoothing as you think fit.  See also the matching discussion.  [This is not a place where periodic fits are needed]
