The problem is as follows:

If you go to https://www.transitchicago.com/data/Links to an external site. you will find a dataset named "Ridership - 'L' Station Entries - Daily Totals" which tells you for each day, how many people got on each CTA rail station that day (for 20 years).

Please submit the code and the answers for

a. What's the busiest station (most boardings) in Chicago?

b. What was the busiest day in these 20 years?

c. What was the least busy weekday? [again: find one day out of 20 years]

Google will explain both the busiest and least busy days - one sentence on what happened in Chicago those days.

Let's now do a similar analysis in a different city.

We want to identify the busiest hours. In the Files folder for this week (week8) are two files extracted from the BART (San Francisco) ridership data.  BARTtenth.csv is a tenth of the 2019 data, BARThundreth.csv is a tenth of that (randomly selected).  (The full file is 250 MB and Canvas won't accept it.)  These files have columns

Day,Hour,Source,Destination,Count

so that the first line of the 1/100th sample is:

2019-01-01,0,BAYF,SANL, 2

which means that on Jan. 1 2019, in the hour between midnight and 1am, 2 people went from Bay Fair to San Leandro. 

The last line is

2019-12-31,23,ROCK,FTVL,1

which says that between 11pm and midnight on Dec. 31, 2019, one person went from Rockridge to Fruitvale (I thought Rock Ridge was a place in the movie Blazing Saddles, but it seems to be a station in the East Bay).

(The station name codes are in https://511.org/transit/agencies/bart-stop-idLinks to an external site. if you care).  The data are from https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership, Links to an external site.where you can find full years available, and in the most recent years you cansee the impact of the pandemic on transit there.
